/*
 Our string is looks like a 2-D Array
 Strings = [
              [His name is ]   // the longest sub-array which size is 13
              [Jun.]
              [He is very ]
              [Cool.]
              ['\0']
            ]
 This is a 5*13 2-D string array. Because we have 5 row
 And the longest string size is 12 which include space and punctuation
 We have two loops.
 Out side loop is iterate in the row, which means check the first sub-array, second-subarray, whoes pointer is Strings.
 Inside loop is check the elements in each sub-array, whose pointer is *Strings.
 By the way, the last sub-array ['\0'] just tell the outside pointer to stop iterate at here.
 
 After concatenate, the answer should be "His name is Jun.He is very Cool."

    char* read = (char*)malloc(100*sizeof(char)); // we will reserved 100 bytes space for output string
    char* copy = read;                           // the pointer copy at here, copy the value to our reserved space

              Result =[  |   |   |   |   |   |   |..............|]
                  read/\copy
     at very begining, pointer read and pointer copy, point to the same address whcih is the first element in our result array
     Our first input string is "His name is"
     
     Result =[ H |   |   |   |   |   |   |..............|]
          read/\copy

          read     copy
     ......
     ......
     
     At last, it looks like

              /                                              \

     Hence, we have two pointers, pointer read for print the result
     Pointer copy: we use *copy which at here is dereference this pointer, 
     let *pointer = ** Strings, to copy the char to our result array
